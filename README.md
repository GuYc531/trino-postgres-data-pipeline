# trino-postgres-data-pipeline

### further improvments

1. set up a git repo for the sql/ folder to be able to change the queries without update the image
2. id column as different data type ( other than text) for more effective querying
3. get columns names from a repo instead of querying the db table
4. using the schema.md in the api to create the tables instead of manually creating them
